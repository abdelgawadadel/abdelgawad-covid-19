<p>The question of how computer systems can make contributions to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic is being posed to professionals in synthetic intelligence (AI) all over the global.<br>
AI equipment can help in lots of different approaches.<br>they may be being used to expect the unfold of the corona virus, map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human,<br> accelerate diagnosis, and in the development of capability treatments,<br> even as also helping policymakers cope with associated troubles, which include the effect on delivery, food materials and tour.<br>
but in these kinds of cases, AI is best effective if it has enough examples to analyze from. As COVID-19 has taken the sector into unchartered territory, the "deep studying" systems, which computers use to acquire new skills, do not necessarily have the information they want to produce beneficial outputs
