	<h2>4ways engineers can help fight corona virus<h2>
<h3>Run the country</h3> 
<p>For Justin Greenhalgh, the excellent way engineers may want to assistance is easy: “by way of being installed charge of the united states and making long-time period choices!”
Others recommended practical approaches of supporting the authorities, inclusive of giving steering on statistical modelling and hazard evaluation, handling deliver chains and helping making plans.
<h3>Prevent future outbreaks</h3>
While the UK and countries around the world struggle with the current outbreak, several readers urged the industry to look ahead and plan for similar – or even worse – situations.
 “We need to use our ingenuity to prevent the problem becoming worse, and avoiding or being prepared for future outbreaks,” said Richard Hulmes.
<h3>enhance domestic industry</h3>
other members hoped the disaster could about over-reliance on foreign imports. “long term, the United Kingdom needs to consider what is manufactured right here. importing all of your vital elements simplest works if there isn't a disaster,” said Richard Goodfellow.
<h3>save you the spread</h3>
With numbers of patients skyrocketing, preventing the spread of Covid-19 is an instantaneous problem. multiple readers advised engineering organizations to design, expand and manufacture more diagnostic kits, in addition to improving logistics to distribute them quicker.
